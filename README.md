# Pong
Orignal pong game | Python | Turtle

In this project, I further developed my skills of functions, classes, inheritance, and turtle. This project is a basic pong game replica built using Turtle. Key concepts within this project included major use of x and y coordinate functions including obtaining these coordinates from various turtles and being able to compare them using the distance function. This project was very fun to build as it is a two-player game that uses event listeners to allow players to use the same keyboard and play head-to-head.
